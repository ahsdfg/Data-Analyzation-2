# Data-Analyzation-2
Contents of the book '혼자 공부하는 데이터분석 with 파이썬'.
The skills handled in the book are elevated from that of previous data-analyzation repository's.
It deals with library data and touches upon API, web scraping, data preprocessing, summarizing data, data visualization and finally verifying and predicting.
The contents were all intriguing but some concepts to highlight are:
- API and Web Scraping: as experience from this book enabled me to make the 'gym-reserver' which is in gym-reserver repository
- data preprocessing: this book was one of the only sources where I learned proper data preprocessing
- verifying and predicting: this book introduced many concepts of statistics, which I was originally interested in
